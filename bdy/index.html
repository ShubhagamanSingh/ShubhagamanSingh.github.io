            <h2>The Beauty</h2>
            <p><br> “Beauty can be bold or natural, but it always has to be in harmony with the individual.”</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card" style="transform:rotate(4.797994808307811deg);"><img src="img/2.jpg" />
            <h2>The You</h2>
            <p><br> “It is not fancy hair, gold jewelry, or fine clothes that should make you beautiful. No, your beauty
                should come from within you – the beauty of a gentle and quiet spirit. This beauty will never disappear,
                and it is worth very much to God.”</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card" style="transform:rotate(-3.590291702648325deg);"><img src="img/3.jpg" />
            <h2>Your Cuteness</h2>
            <p><br> “When a girl has gone through the journey of finding and pursuing her most authentic self, and
                shares that gift, for me, that’s beautiful.”</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card" style="transform:rotate(2.6788126728626294deg);"><img src="img/4.jpg" />
            <h2>Your Style</h2>
            <p><br> “Never limit yourself because of others’ limited imagination; never limit others because of your own
                limited imagination.”</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card" style="transform:rotate(-3.208211947596147deg);"><img src="img/5.jpg" />
            <h2>Your Eyes</h2>
            <p><br> “Your eyes are the brightest things I have ever seen, maybe even brighter than the stars above. And actually, I can't explain.”</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card" style="transform:rotate(1.5058236457863323deg);"><img src="img/6.jpg" />
            <h2>Your Love</h2>
            <p><br> “A woman has two smiles that an angel might envy, the smile that accepts a lover before words are
                uttered, and the smile that lights on the first born babe, and assures it of a mother’s love.”</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card" style="transform:rotate(-1.4125994215693316deg);"><img src="img/7.jpg" />
            <h2>Your Company</h2>
            <p><br> “That’s the thing about inner beauty: unlike physical beauty, which grabs the spotlight on itself,
                inner beauty shines on everyone, catching them, holding them in its embrace, making them more
                beautiful.”</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card" style="transform:rotate(1.3803847537516356deg);"><img src="img/8.jpg" />
            <h2>Your Expressions</h2>
            <p><br> “You are beautiful because of the light you carry inside you. You are beautiful because you say you
                are, and you hold yourself that way.”</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card" style="transform:rotate(-2.187510149029146deg);"><img src="img/9.jpg" />
            <h2>Your Smile</h2>
            <p><br> “For beautiful eyes, look for the good in others; for beautiful lips, speak only words of kindness;
                and for poise, walk with the knowledge that you are never alone.”</p>
        </div>

            <h2>Your Childish</h2>
            <p><br> “If sixty seconds would ever make a minute, and 24 hours would make a day, I want to spend it all
                with you throughout the year. I am best with you.”</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card" style="transform:rotate(0.6893619360579617deg);"><img src="img/11.jpg" />
            <h2>Your Girlishness</h2>
            <p><br> “People often say that beauty is in the eye of the beholder, and I say that the most liberating
                thing about beauty is realizing you are the beholder.”</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card" style="transform:rotate(-3.3620446160385deg);"><img src="img/12.jpg" />
            <h2>Your Passion</h2>
            <p><br> “I have always thought that a person can experience happiness once in a lifetime, but with you, I
                realized that happiness for me is every minute, every second, every romantic day that I spend with you
                and moments when I hold you in my arms.”</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card" style="transform:rotate(-4.506674555529074deg);"><img src="img/13.jpg" />
            <h2>Tour Fassion</h2>
            <p><br> “When virtue and modesty enlighten her charms, the luster of a beautiful girl is brighter than the
                stars of heaven, and the influence of her power it is in vain to resist.”</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card" style="transform:rotate(-0.17315261778177327deg);"><img src="img/14.jpg" />
            <h2>Killer Looks</h2>
            <p><br> “Sometimes I just think back to the first time I laid eyes on you. I knew right then that I had
                found someone incredible. Ever since that very moment, all I have ever wanted was to be with you. No
                matter how dark my day is, seeing you always brighten it and makes me realize that with you, I am doing
                right.”</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card" style="transform:rotate(2.5000180574627713deg);"><img src="img/15.jpg" />
            <h2>Your Laugh</h2>
            <p><br> “Your beauty mesmerizes me. Your sense of humor puts a smile on my face. Your kindness and
                compassion fill me with awe. My friend, thank you for being all that I could ask for in a woman and so
                much more.”</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card" style="transform:rotate(-2.0226664071074985deg);"><img src="img/16.jpg" />
            <h2>Your Careness</h2>
            <p><br> “A flower does not think of competing with the flower next to it. It just blooms.”</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card" style="transform:rotate(4.178287790945118deg);"><img src="img/17.jpg" />
            <h2>Your Naughtiness</h2>
            <p><br> “Real beauty isn’t about symmetry or weight or makeup: it’s about looking life right in the face and
                seeing all its magnificence reflected in your own.”</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card" style="transform:rotate(-0.5069412614067881deg);"><img src="img/18.jpg" />
            <h2>Your Attitude</h2>
            <p><br> “Not the sky nor the clouds reveal heaven to me but your beautiful smile gives me a crystal clear
                picture of what heaven looks like.”</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card" style="transform:rotate(-1.373319977471683deg);"><img src="img/19.jpg" />
            <h2>Your Blush</h2>
            <p><br> “A woman whose smile is open and whose expression is glad has a kind of beauty no matter what she
                wears.”</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card" style="transform:rotate(-2.0226664071074985deg);"><img src="img/20.jpg" />
            <h2>You'r Crush</h2>
            <p><br> “The beauty of a girl is not in a facial mole, but true beauty in a woman is reflected in her soul.
                It is the caring that she lovingly gives, the passion that she knows.”</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card" style="transform:rotate(-4.506674555529074deg);"><img src="img/21.jpg" />
            <h2>Your Harmony</h2>
            <p><br> “Girls don’t need a short and tight skirt or a low cut top to impress a guy. A girl doesn’t need a
                lot of makeup on their face to look beautiful, all a girl needs to look beautiful is a nice personality,
                a natural smile, and to be true to themselves.”</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card" style="transform:rotate(-0.17315261778177327deg);"><img src="img/22.jpg" />
            <h2>Your Anger</h2>
            <p><br> “True beauty lies deep within. No matter what you look like on the outside, if you know you are
                beautiful, nothing can change that.”</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card" style="transform:rotate(-2.0226664071074985deg);"><img src="img/23.jpg" />
            <h2>You'r Danger</h2>
            <p><br> “Every night I go to sleep thinking about how blessed I am to have you in my life. You are my Sun,
                Moon, and the Stars, and I will do anything for you, love. Thank you for being with me.”</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card" style="transform:rotate(2.5000180574627713deg);"><img src="img/24.jpg" />
            <h2>My Omniverse</h2>
            <p><br> “The only thing that has no end is my love for you. You give me the strongest feeling I’ve ever
                known, and I will never let it go. You are my dream come true, the biggest blessing I have ever received
                from God. I will love you forever.”</p>
